# Unified Resilience

This used to be the central point for my work with the RSL at USC Columbia,
when I was working remotely. The actual day-to-day work has moved to private
repositories under the lab account, and so now this repository is for working
with all the open-source components developed in my work with the lab.

The scripts themselves are released under the MIT license. The individual
submodule projects are under various licenses.

You can view the old version on the `old-private` branch, but there isn't much
to see, as much of the public-facing features are also present in the new
version.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:NighttimeDriver50000/unified-resilience.git
$ cd unified-resilience
$ ./gitscripts/pull-submodules.sh
$ vagrant up usc-ros
```
